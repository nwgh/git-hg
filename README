This is a SIMPLE wrapper to allow read/write access to Mercurial repositories
from Git. Do `git help hg` for usage information.

Why did I write this? Because I work somewhere that uses hg, but I prefer git,
and I didn't want to jump through a lot of hoops manually using hg-git to use
my preferred DSCM. So, I wrote this to streamline my process a bit. It may or
may not work for you, but it works for me, and that's what matters to me.
