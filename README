This is a SIMPLE wrapper to allow read/write access to Mercurial repositories
from Git. Do `git help hg` for usage information.

This program contains bits of the following pieces of software:

fast-export (MIT, git://repo.or.cz/fast-export.git)
hg-fastimport (GPLv2, http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/hg-fastimport)
pyfastimport (GPLv2, https://code.launchpad.net/~gward/bzr-fastimport/reusable)

WARNING!! WARNUNG!! AVERTISSEMENT!! ADVERTENCIA!! WAARSCHUWING!! AVVERTIMENTO!!

This software is VERY MUCH under HEAVY development. Even though I don't have
much time to work on it (and thus may not commit for a few days or weeks), don't
expect the code to look the same from one commit to the next (at least until
this warning is gone from the README).

Things that don't work:
Pull (it'll fetch, just won't update your current branch)
Push (won't do much of anything).
Possibly other things!
